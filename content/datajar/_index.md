Rubix Datum currently provides a solution to prevent data tampering and manipulation using Rubix Chain. Any user running Rubix Node can be part of Rubix Datum and can commit data as batches into the Rubix Chain, with Rubix’s peer-to-peer, immutable & truly decentralized blockchain platform that can scale significantly with asynchronous parallelism and support real-world decentralized applications and Rubix deploys a superior consensus mechanism ‘Proof-of-Pledge’ (PoP) — a lightweight algorithm, which reduces carbon emissions significantly. Its on-chain validation makes the network immutable.
